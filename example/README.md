## Directed Graph - Example
The file [`example.dart`][example.dart] (see folder *bin*) contains a short program that demonstrates how to create
a numerical representation of the directed graph shown in the figure below using the package [`directed_graph`][directed_graph].

The program also shows how to add/remove vertices and edges, determine if the graph is acyclic, or
obtain a list of vertices in topological order.

<!-- The methods `stronglyConnectedComponents` and `shortestPath` are provided for convenience
only as they are simply calling the homonymously named functions provided by the package [`graphs`][graphs]. -->

The program can be run in a terminal by navigating to the
folder *directed_graph/example* in your local copy of this library and using the command:
```Console
$ dart bin/example.dart
```
