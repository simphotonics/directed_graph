## Directed Graph - Example
The files located in the folder *bin* contain short programs that demonstrate how
to:
* create a numerical representation of the directed graph shown in the figure below using the class [`DirectedGraph`][DirectedGraph] ,
* create an object of type [`WeightedDirectedGraph`][WeightedDirectedGraph] and find the *shortest*, *lightest*, and *heaviest* path between two vertices,
* use the class [`GraphCrawler`][GraphCrawler].
